The organization aids in smooth navigation and understanding of the project's components. Relevant snippets include:
  - `main.py`: 
    ```python
    import logging
    from src.data_preparation import DataPreparation
    from pathlib import Path
    config_path = "./src/config.yaml"
    main_dir = Path(__file__).parent
    data_path = main_dir / "./data/resale_transactions_categorised.csv"
    ```
  - `readme.md`:
    ```markdown
    # jonyling-ClassificationEndToEnd
    ```
  - `config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    file_path: ./data/resale_transactions_categorised.csv
    param_grid: {"ridge_tuned": {"classifier__alpha": [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]}}
    ```

- **Data Cleaning**: You performed comprehensive data cleaning on the HDB resale flats dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies. This ensures the dataset is robust for further processing. Key snippets include:
  - `data_preparation.py`:
    ```python
    # Validate required columns
    required_columns = ['flat_type', 'lease_commence_date', 'remaining_lease', 'town_id', 'flatm_id', 'town_name', 'flatm_name', 'month', 'storey_range', 'floor_area_sqm', 'id']
    missing_cols = [col for col in required_columns if col not in df.columns]
    if missing_cols:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required columns: {missing_cols}")
    
    # Remove duplicates
    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
    
    # Impute missing numerical values
    df[self.config["numerical_features"]] = df[self.config["numerical_features"]].fillna(df[self.config["numerical_features"]].median())
    
    # Encode price_category to numeric values
    label_mapping = {'Below Median': 0, 'Above Median': 1}
    df["price_category"] = df["price_category"].map(label_mapping)
    ```

- **Baseline Model Development**: You developed a baseline model using simple algorithms like Logistic Regression and Ridge Classifier, which serves as a reference point for more complex models. Evidence from:
  - `model_training.py`:
    ```python
    models = {
        "logistic_regression": LogisticRegression(random_state=42),
        "ridge": RidgeClassifier(random_state=42),
    }
    
    pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    return pipelines, metrics
    ```
  - `main.py`:
    ```python
    baseline_models, baseline_metrics = (
        model_training.train_and_evaluate_baseline_models(
            X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val
        )
    )
    ```

- **Model Evaluation**: You evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best model for classifying HDB resale flats prices. This step is well-documented with snippets like:
  - `model_training.py`:
    ```python
    metrics = {
        "Accuracy": accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred),
        "F1": f1_score(y_test, y_test_pred),
        "ROC-AUC": roc_auc_score(y_test, y_test_pred),
    }
    
    metrics = {
        "Accuracy": accuracy_score(y_val, y_val_pred),
        "F1": f1_score(y_val, y_val_pred),
        "ROC-AUC": roc_auc_score(y_val, y_val_pred),
    }
    ```
  - `main.py`:
    ```python
    best_model_name = max(all_metrics, key=lambda k: all_metrics[k]["F1"])
    ```

### Steps Fulfilled (Partially):
- **Development of Additional Models**: While you included baseline models and a tuned version of Ridge Classifier, the exploration of additional algorithms like Random Forest or ensemble methods was limited. This step could be enhanced by incorporating a broader range of models for comparison.
  - `model_training.py`:
    ```python
    models = {
        "logistic_regression": LogisticRegression(random_state=42),
        "ridge": RidgeClassifier(random_state=42),
        "ridge_tuned": RidgeClassifier(random_state=42)
     }
     ```
  - `main.py`:
     ```python
     tuned_models, tuned_metrics = model_training.train_and_evaluate_tuned_models(
         X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val
     )
     ```
  - `config.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     param_grid: {"ridge_tuned": {"classifier__alpha": [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]}}
     ```

- **Documentation of Findings**: The README lacks comprehensive documentation of findings and insights from EDA or model evaluations. While some insights are logged within scripts like `model_training.py`, they are not reflected in the README.
  - `readme.md` only contains the project title without detailed documentation.
  - Logging snippets in `model_training.py` and `data_preparation.py` indicate some level of documentation within the code but not in the README.

### Steps Not Fulfilled:
- There are no steps that were completely unfulfilled based on the provided evaluation. However, enhancing the partially fulfilled steps would significantly improve the overall project quality and completeness.
## Things to Work on

- **Expand Model Exploration**: Your current pipeline includes baseline models like Logistic Regression and Ridge Classifier, along with a tuned version of the Ridge Classifier. To enhance the completeness of your model exploration, consider incorporating additional algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or AdaBoost. These models can potentially offer better performance and provide a broader range of options for comparison. This will not only improve the robustness of your solution but also give you insights into which types of models work best for your specific dataset.

- **Enhance Hyperparameter Tuning**: While you have implemented hyperparameter tuning for the Ridge Classifier, expanding this process to other models can significantly improve their performance. Consider using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization across different algorithms. Clearly document the setup and rationale behind the chosen parameters for each model to provide clarity and transparency in your approach.

- **Comprehensive Documentation in README**: The README file currently lacks detailed documentation of your findings, insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model evaluations, and final model selection. To address this, include a structured narrative that outlines the key steps in your pipeline, insights gained from EDA, and a detailed comparison of model performances. Visualizations from EDA can be particularly helpful in conveying data insights effectively. This documentation will not only aid in reproducibility but also enhance the understanding of your workflow for others reviewing your project.

- **Clarify Logging Insights**: While you have logging statements within your code to capture insights during model training and evaluation, these insights are not reflected in the README. Ensure that significant findings or observations logged during the process are summarized and included in your documentation. This will provide a clearer picture of how decisions were made throughout the project and highlight any challenges encountered and how they were addressed.

By addressing these areas, you will improve both the technical robustness of your machine learning pipeline and the clarity of its documentation, making it more comprehensive and accessible to others.
## Code Evaluation 
#### model_training.py
- Your code effectively utilizes built-in functions, such as `train_test_split` and `GridSearchCV`, which enhances the efficiency of your model training process. This is commendable as it leverages established libraries to streamline operations.
- However, there are areas where the algorithm could be optimized. For instance, the `train_and_evaluate_baseline_models` method trains multiple models sequentially, which may not be efficient for larger datasets. Consider parallelizing model training to improve performance.
- Additionally, while your code is well-organized and follows a logical flow, some methods lack detailed comments explaining their logic. Adding comments, especially in complex methods like `train_and_evaluate_tuned_models`, would greatly enhance readability and maintainability.
- You should also implement checks for edge cases, such as when the input DataFrame is empty or when the target column is missing. This will make your code more robust and prevent potential runtime errors.
- Lastly, ensure consistent spacing around operators and commas throughout your code. Using a linter or formatter like `black` can help you adhere to PEP 8 standards automatically.

### Actions Required:
1. **Optimize Model Training**: Consider using libraries like `joblib` to parallelize the model training process. For example, you can use `Parallel` and `delayed` from `joblib` to run model training in parallel.
2. **Add Detailed Comments**: Go through each method and add comments explaining the purpose and logic, especially in complex methods like `train_and_evaluate_tuned_models`. For instance, explain what hyperparameter tuning is and why it's important.
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Implement checks for empty DataFrames at the beginning of methods that require data input. For example, in the `split_data` method, add a check like `if df.empty: raise ValueError('Input DataFrame is empty')`.
4. **Ensure Consistent Spacing**: Review the code for consistent spacing around operators and commas. Use a linter or formatter like `black` to automatically format your code according to PEP 8 standards.
#### data_preparation.py
- Your code effectively utilizes built-in functions, such as `pd.to_datetime` for date conversion and `drop_duplicates` for removing duplicates, which enhances the efficiency of your data cleaning process. This is commendable as it leverages established libraries to streamline operations.
- However, there are areas where the algorithm could be optimized. For instance, the `_fill_missing_names` method could be made more efficient by using vectorized operations instead of applying functions row-wise. This would significantly improve performance, especially with larger datasets.
- Additionally, while your code is generally well-organized, the `_create_preprocessor` method is defined within the `__init__` method, which can lead to confusion. Improving the organization of your code will enhance clarity and maintainability. Furthermore, more comments are needed to explain the logic behind complex operations, particularly in the `clean_data` method.
- You should also implement checks for edge cases, such as when the input DataFrame is empty before processing. This will make your code more robust and prevent potential runtime errors.

### Actions Required:
1. **Optimize `_fill_missing_names` Method**: Consider using vectorized operations or merging DataFrames to fill missing names more efficiently. For example, instead of using `.map()`, you could use a merge operation to fill missing values based on IDs.
2. **Add Empty DataFrame Check**: Implement a check for empty DataFrames at the beginning of the `clean_data` method to prevent errors during processing. For example:
   ```python
   if df.empty:
       raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")
   ```
3. **Improve Code Organization**: Move the `_create_preprocessor` method outside of the `__init__` method to enhance clarity and organization within your class.
4. **Increase Comments**: Add comments throughout your code, especially in complex sections like data cleaning and transformation, to help future readers understand the logic and purpose of key operations.
#### main.py
- Your code effectively avoids redundancy by not repeating code unnecessarily. For instance, the way you load the configuration and data is streamlined, which enhances maintainability and clarity.
- However, there are areas where the algorithm could be optimized. Specifically, the loading of the configuration file and data could be improved by checking if the files exist before attempting to load them. This would prevent potential runtime errors if the files are missing.
- Additionally, while your code is generally well-organized, the `main` function could benefit from being broken down into smaller functions for better clarity. This would make it easier to follow the flow of operations and enhance readability. Furthermore, more comments explaining the purpose of each section would greatly improve understanding.

### Actions Required:
1. **Add File Existence Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that the configuration and data files exist before attempting to load them. You can use `os.path.exists` to verify file existence. For example:
   ```python
   import os
   if not os.path.exists(config_path):
       raise FileNotFoundError(f"Configuration file not found: {config_path}")
   ```
2. **Implement Error Handling for CSV Loading**: Use a try-except block around the CSV loading process to catch any exceptions that may arise during file reading. This will help in gracefully handling errors related to file access.
   ```python
   try:
       df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
   except Exception as e:
       logging.error(f"Error loading data: {e}")
       raise
   ```
3. **Break Down the Main Function**: Consider creating separate functions for loading configuration, loading data, and running model training. This will make your code more modular and easier to test.
4. **Enhance Comments**: Add comments throughout the `main` function to explain the purpose of each step, especially for complex operations like data preparation and model training. This will help future readers understand your code more easily.
#### config.yaml
- Your configuration file is well-structured and avoids redundancy, which is commendable. For example, the way you define the `param_grid` for hyperparameter tuning is clear and concise:
  ```yaml
  "param_grid": {
      "ridge_tuned": {"classifier__alpha": [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]}
  }
  ```
- However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in the documentation of your parameters. The lack of comments explaining the purpose of each parameter can lead to confusion for someone unfamiliar with the context. Adding comments would enhance clarity and usability.
- Additionally, while your configuration handles basic data types well, it lacks provisions for edge cases, such as missing or unexpected values in the input data. Implementing validation checks for the input data structure and types would make your configuration more robust.

### Actions Required:
1. **Add Comments to Parameters**: Include comments next to each parameter in the `config.yaml` file to explain their purpose. For example:
   ```yaml
   'val_test_size': 0.2,  # Proportion of data to be used for validation and testing
   ```
2. **Implement Validation Checks**: Consider adding validation checks for the input data structure to ensure that all specified features exist in the dataset before training the model. For instance:
   ```python
   # Check if 'numerical_features' are present in the DataFrame columns.
   if not all(feature in df.columns for feature in self.config["numerical_features"]):
       raise ValueError("Some numerical features are missing from the DataFrame.")
   ```
3. **Add Error Handling for Parameter Values**: Implement checks to ensure that parameter values are within expected ranges or types. For example, validate that all values in `param_grid` are positive numbers:
   ```python
   # Ensure alpha values are valid
   if any(alpha <= 0 for alpha in self.config["param_grid"]["ridge_tuned"]["classifier__alpha"]):
       raise ValueError("Alpha values must be positive.")
   ```

### Pipeline Best Practices

Your machine learning pipeline demonstrates a solid foundation with well-organized code and effective use of logging. However, there are areas that require further attention to enhance the robustness and usability of your project.

#### Well done:
- **Modularity**: Your code is modular and well-organized, with distinct components for data preprocessing and model training. This separation of concerns enhances reusability and maintainability. By encapsulating functionalities within appropriate modules, such as `DataPreparation` for data cleaning and `ModelTraining` for model training, you adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, which is crucial for scalable software design.
  
- **Project Structure**: The project is organized with a logical directory layout that separates different components. This structure follows industry-standard practices, supporting scalability and maintainability. The use of a 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies and a 'config.yaml' for configuration settings is commendable as it aids in managing project dependencies and configurations effectively.

- **Logging**: You have implemented comprehensive and consistent logging throughout the application. This provides insights into the application's behavior, which is essential for debugging and monitoring. Using Python’s standard logging module effectively ensures that all critical actions are logged, maintaining a consistent logging format throughout.

- **Dependency Specification**: You have specified dependencies explicitly using a `requirements.txt` file, which is a common practice for Python projects. This ensures that the environment can be replicated accurately, which is crucial for maintaining consistency across different setups.

#### To be improved:
- **Code Commenting**: While your code includes comments and docstrings for many functions, some critical sections lack sufficient detail. For instance, the `train_and_evaluate_baseline_models` function could benefit from more detailed explanations of the model training process and the metrics being evaluated. Comprehensive comments are important as they enhance understanding and facilitate easier maintenance of the code.

- **Documentation**: The documentation provides a basic overview but lacks detailed usage instructions and module-level explanations. A more detailed README with setup guides or usage instructions would greatly benefit users trying to understand or use your project. Good documentation is essential as it serves as a guide for users to understand how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.

- **Error Handling**: Your code handles several potential error conditions but could benefit from additional error handling in areas such as reading configuration files or loading CSV data. Robust error handling with meaningful messages is important as it helps in diagnosing issues quickly and provides fallback mechanisms to ensure the application remains stable under unexpected conditions.

- **Environment Management**: While you have provided a `requirements.txt` file, there is no mention of using Docker or any other containerization tool. Using such tools would enhance reproducibility and consistency across different machines. Effective environment management ensures that your project can be easily set up in any environment without compatibility issues.

#### Missing completely:
- **Unit Testing**: There are no unit tests present in your MLP. Implementing unit tests is crucial as they verify the functionality of individual components, ensuring reliability and correctness of your codebase. Without unit tests, it becomes challenging to identify bugs early in the development process or when changes are made to the code.

- **Integration Testing**: Although you have implemented a pipeline that integrates data preparation and model training, there are no explicit integration tests provided to verify these interactions. Integration tests are important as they ensure that different modules work seamlessly together, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of complex systems.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly improve the robustness, usability, and maintainability of your machine learning pipeline.
